# Exercise 1: Draw a cat to the terminal

- Run the `draw_cat.sh` script to see the cat

# Exercise 2: Find the cat!

- Use `ls -la` and `cd` to find the randomly-named directory to find the `cat.txt`
    - These are all located in `hiding_places`

# Exercise 3: Put the cat in a new hiding place

- Run the `hide_cat.sh` script and find the cat one more time

# BONUS: Read the comments in `hide_cat.sh`

To improve as a developer, a good exercise is to read code that is completely unfamiliar and see what parts you can figure out.

At first, it will feel a lot like guessing. But as you look at different parts of the code, you'll start to see how they fit together.

Once you have a general idea of what the code does, you'll be able to deduce how the smaller parts work.

Try reading through `hide_cat.sh` and use the comments to guide you.

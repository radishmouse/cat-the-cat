# Exercise 1: Draw a cat to the terminal

- Run the `draw_cat.sh` script to see the (amazingly artistic) cat drawing.

# Exercise 2: Find the cat!

- Use `ls -la` and `cd` to find the randomly-named directory to find the `cat.txt`
    - These are all located in `hiding_places`

# Exercise 3: Put the cat in a new hiding place

- Run the `hide_cat.sh` script and find the cat one more time.
    - The cat will be in a new hiding place.

# BONUS 1: How would you do it?

What shell commands would you have to use in order to create the directories and create `cat.txt`?

Write down the steps you would need to take.
For each step, ask yourself if you know what shell command to use. If you do, write down the name of the command. If you don't write down what you might search for.

# BONUS 2: Read the comments in `hide_cat.sh`

To improve as a developer, a good exercise is to read code that is completely unfamiliar and see what parts you can figure out.

At first, it will feel a lot like guessing. But as you look at different parts of the code, you'll start to see how they fit together.

Once you have a general idea of what the code does, you'll be able to deduce how the smaller parts work.

Try reading through `hide_cat.sh` and use the comments to guide you.
